# Image-Super-Resolution
## An Enhanced Deep Residual Network for image super resolution task

We used a model named EDSR which is implementation of the paper "Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution" from CVPRW 2017, 2nd NTIRE.

Simply, to run the model you have to follow instructions on this repo [a link](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch)
